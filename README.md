#MasterThesis DiabeticRetinopathyDetection

Small part of code used in my Masters Thesis "Detection of diabetic retinopathy using machine learning".
Results were submitted to Kaggle as a part of Diabetic Retinopathy Detection challenge.
Achieved kappa score 0.30965.

My opinion that this method could be optimized and enhanced to achieve better results.

Developed method is based on http://www.cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/papers/coatesng_nntot2012.pdf.
